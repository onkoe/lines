When it comes to laptops, there are a lot of options. For me, a good laptop has: 
- Good battery (80 Wh or higher)
- A 3:2/16:10 display with 350+ nits and a resolution of 1600p or higher
- 14 inch panel
- A power efficient (Ryzen/ARM) processor
- The ability to run Linux natively 

Sadly, I'm yet to find any laptops that have all of these specs. Here are my current choices: 

## Laptops

### [TUXEDO Pulse 15 Gen2](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Notebooks/15-16-inch/TUXEDO-Pulse-15-Gen2.tuxedo)
- Battery: Great! 91 Wh! 
- Display: Not ideal. 16:9 and under 1600p. 350 nits. 
- Panel size: Not ideal. 15 inches. 
- Processor: Perfect! The 5700U is very efficient!
- Linux support: Yes!

This machine is a good contender if it got a better display. Oh well!

### [Apple MacBook Pro 14" (2021)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch)
- Battery: Good - 70 Wh. 
- Display: Almost perfect! 500 nits, over 1600p, and a great aspect ratio of 16:10! The notch can get in the way of some applications. 
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.2 inches. 
- Processor: Perfect! The M1 Pro can run almost anything!
- Linux support: On-going work. Speakers don't work, graphics are only half-finished, and battery life is not there yet. 

When [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) gets some of these Linux features completed, the MBP will be a great machine!

### [SLIMBOOK Executive 14"](https://slimbook.es/en/executive-en)
- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh! 
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 400 nits. The resolution is at 1800p.
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches. 
- Processor: Not ideal. Intel's 12th and 13th generation chips are not power efficient and tend to run poorly due to heating problems. 
- Linux support: Yes!

This machine is only limited by the Intel chip inside. Otherwise, it's nearly perfect!

### [SCHENKER VIA 15 Pro](https://www.schenker-tech.de/en/schenker-via-15-pro-m22/)
- Battery: Perfect! 91 Wh. 
- Display: Not ideal. 16:9 at 1440p. 300 nits is too dark in some outdoor settings. 
- Panel size: Not ideal. 15 inches. 
- Processor: Perfect! The 5700U is very efficient! 
- Linux support: Yes!

While it's still 15 inches, this machine would be great with a better display. 

### [SCHENKER Vision 15 (E22)](https://www.schenker-tech.de/en/schenker-vision-14-e22/)
- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 380 nits with a resolution of 1800p. 
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches. 
- Processor: Not ideal. The i7-12700H is not efficient, and the split cores are often causes of bugs across operating systems. 
- Linux support: Yes!

This machine would be great with a better processor! 

### [Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-studio/8srdf62swkpf)
- Battery: Not ideal. 58 Wh. 
- Display: Perfect! 3:2 at 1600p, with around 500 nits. 
- Panel size: Perfect! 14.4 inches.
- Processor: Not ideal. The i5-11300H and i7-11370H are both quad core processors. Power usage is nice, though!
- Linux support: Mostly works with lots of setup. Requires the use of [linux-surface](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Supported-Devices-and-Features) for any kind of good experience. 

This machine has a great design, but some parts of the device are outdated or locked down. An updated version using common parts would be great!

### [TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 14 (Gen7)](https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-Gen7.tuxedo)
- Battery: Perfect! 99 Wh!
- Display: Perfect! 16:10 at 1800p, with 400 nits of power!
- Panel size: Perfect! 14 inches!
- Processor: Not ideal. The Intel Core 12k and 13k series processors are power hungry and run hot. The i7-12000H is no exception. 
- Linux support: Yes!

So far, this is my favorite machine. A Ryzen version would be the perfect laptop in my view.
